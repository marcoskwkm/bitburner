**Main idea:** Get 4 huge investment rounds, then go public.

### 1st investment round

- Start in a cheap industry (restaurant)
- Expand to all cities
- Expand warehouse storage to 200 in all cities
- Expand to 6 employees in all cities, all in business
- Buy 1 Wilson Analytics and 2 ABC SalesBots upgrades
- Hire AdVert 26 times
- Fill every warehouse with Real Estate
- Quickly (preferably with a script) set Real Estate sell config to MAX/MP in all cities
- Wait for 10 cycles, then find an investor. Offer should be at least 4t.
